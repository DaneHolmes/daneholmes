				<h1>Fall Description</h1>
				<p>In the late-summer of that year, I rented a room in a town that looked over the cliffs, and on to the sea, and sometimes onto the rising sun. Despite my habit of waking up early to take long walks in the salt-filled air, I rarely saw the sunrise. That year the trees along the sea were caught in an indefinite state of deepening color yet battled an unwillingness to have their leaves fall.</p>
				<p>As I walked under these trees, along the ocean, the sea mist obscuring all my senses, the rain would fall. The rain fell, the mist soaked through me, and I walked. Walking the same roads, I told myself I was going aimlessly. I followed the ocean and the trees, listening with my dulled senses to the white-crested, iron waves break onto the cliffs and crash into my ear.</p>
				<p>All that autumn, the road along the cliffs, outside of town, and under the trees, was red and alive. A combination of two-slatted fences and short-stone walls—faded with age at their tops—lined the road, whose surface was dense with puddles. Leaves slipped from branches, falling with the rain, dropping at my feet. And every morning, the sun rose, softening the sky and turning its edges pale.</p>
				<p>I kept walking, sometimes looking up, but mostly down at the nestled leaves and the muddy water running into the folds of the hills. When I lifted my head, fine-beads of mist quickly filled my eyes, circling my vision, reflecting lights into dozens of dancing, yellow points on my eyes.</p>
				<p>I remember the road bent inland, towards the west. Darkly, I looked down that westward road towards the deep, setting sun, whose rays capped the distant hills to the west. The trees bent and set into an ever more unrestrained red until there were no other colors, and the sun sank away. I never walked that road at dusk. But, in the spring, the crickets chirped, and students would run through the hills and between the trees, triumphant. In the spring, the air wasn’t so salty.</p>
