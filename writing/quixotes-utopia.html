			<h1><strong>The Search for Utopia in</strong> <span class="strongem">Don Quixote</span></h1>
				<p><em>Don Quixote</em> by Miguel De Cervantes is about Don Quixote and his quest to find and validate his idea of utopia. His first adventure where he becomes knighted at an inn acts as a microcosm for the novel as a whole. It demonstrates how Don Quixote’ inclinations regarding the physical existence of utopia is reliant upon other and mirrors society and his surroundings. His quest to find utopia is fueled by comforts of the past, ideals of chivalry, cynicism regarding modernity, and a desperation to find contentment in daily life. Don Quixote starts his quest with surety regarding utopia. Then, while on his quest, his beliefs in chivalry become subverted, and so too does his utopia.</p>
				<p>Don Quixote’s existence is at odds with every facet of reality around him. Yet, he intensely and subconsciously occupies the period in which Cervantes wrote <em>Don Quixote</em>. Cervantes understood the enormous change that was occurring in Europe shortly before and during his life with a shocking clairvoyance. He wrote <em>Don Quixote</em> and the world within the book as part of the same paradigm shift that was changing every part of daily existence. Don Quixote then occupies this transition as a relic of Spain’s recent past. This is painfully evident from the very first description of Don Quixote where he is reported to be a man who is, “one of those who has a lance and ancient shield on a shelf” (Cervantes 19). Don Quixote’s being “one of those,” shows that, from the perspective of the narrator, Don Quixote is different and separate minority. He is a man whose family heritage literally hangs unused in house. Time has moved on without Don Quixote’s and he now serves no function. The sentence codes Don Quixote heavily with the idea of decay. He is a relic of the past and his utopia comes to embrace that.</p>
				<p>	Cervantes, through Don Quixote, is explaining the time in which he lives. The middle-ages are recently, yet distinctly over; however, the holdovers and impact of it still loom large. Don Quixote is one of the remnants of what is quickly becoming history. He is a landowner who needs to “sell acres of arable land,” (Cervantes 20) and is not a noble. His purpose is vague in the modern world, and his station's lack of purpose persistently presses upon his conscience. He abandons daily life to read, “he forgot almost completely about the hunt and even the administration of his estate” (Cervantes 20). Therefore, the origin of his utopia is a retreat to the fictional past of knight-errantry. Retreating allows his to both escape the reality of having to confront his newly found lack of purpose. And, to escape from what he sees as the madness of daily life and the modern world.</p>
				<p>	The total absorption into his utopia starts when he adopts the name of “Don Quixote.” “He called himself <em>Don Quixote of La Mancha</em>, thereby, to his mind, clearly stating his lineage and country and honoring it by making it his title” (Cervantes 23). Adopting a new name acts both as a change in his identity and as a retreat towards the past. This is mostly done though the assuming of the rank of “Don.” The title places emphasis upon his heritage and nobility. Its exaggeration acts to place stress on his rapid decay in a modern world. Ultimately, by adopting the name Don Quixote, Don Quixote is attempting to pick up the “lance and ancient shield” (Cervantes 19) from off the shelf.</p>
				<p>	As a consequence of his discomfort at the beginning of the book, Don Quixote’s utopia is born from his absolute feelings towards the present. Knight-errantry and what it entails is just his recoil from himself being lost in the present. He sees knight-errantry has being “filled with significance,” to the point where he willing gives “himself and everything pertaining to him,” over to it (Cervantes 24). He chooses to solely occupy his utopia and use it as a retreat to the dubious, fictional past of knight errantry. This knight-errant version of utopia then operates as his sole mode of understanding for much of the book. Meanwhile, the book determinedly shifts, changes, and mixes genres around a hero who almost seems to become an interloper. Episodes will start as the model of a chivalric romance, yet will end in a pastoral paradise shrouded in tragedy. This world of confusion that surrounds the story of Don Quixote is reflective a fundamental dissatisfaction with the present. And the picaresque nature of his journey combines to slowly break down his utopia.</p>
				<p>	Before, his utopia beings to break down he experiences multiple validations of its correctness. The first of which is his adventure at the inn. Here is the first place on his journey where his knight-errant utopia vision is forced to interact with the modern world. It interweaves in such a way that his utopia manages to take precedence over reality, not just for him, but for others. For example, the innkeeper, who Don Quixote deems to be a lord, originally “looked at him [Don Quixote] and was perplexed” and “insisted that he get up” (Cervantes 30). Quickly, then the inn keeper is inexplicably swallowed into Don Quixote’s utopian vision and “proposed to humor him” (Cervantes 30). This humoring ultimately has disastrous consequences.</p>
				<p>	The individuality of Don Quixotes utopia becomes so intensely focused that it starts to potentially causes great harm to others. Some people, like the prostitutes, who “when they heard themselves called maidens,” played along and only had to, “control their laughter” (Cervantes 26). But, people like the muleteer who, “cared nothing for these words” was swiftly dealt with by Don Quixote who, “gave the muledriver so heavy a blow on the head that he knocked him to the ground” (Cervantes 32). Nearly murdering a man in the name of his utopia, Don Quixote, “began to place again with the same tranquility as before” (Cervantes 32). This violet outburst, was caused by dishonor to the chivalric code—part of Don Quixote’s knight-errant utopia—and is characteristic of Don Quixote’s utopian vision. His utopia is highly individual. Meaning, only Don Quixote is able to occupy the mind that fuels it. Yet, everyone else, for the utopian vision to work must bow to its tenants. It is a group effort, yet its rewards are individual.</p>
				<p>	This mindset is reflective of Cervante’s modern Spain. Don Quixote starts to embody the change he most fears. He abandons his insignificant past life in favor of the modern spirit of exploration and growth. Like Spain's exploration of the world, he blunders confidently and forces his wisdom on to others. As, idealistically speaking, Spain is discovering new lands, people, and cultures, so is Don Quixote. Moreover, everywhere that he goes, nothing goes unchanged. More realistically, Don Quixote is discovering new lands and leaving death and harm in his wake. The events at the inn are fairly representative of this, with a muledriver left nearly dead and the inn keeper left unpaid. He continues on, ending his next adventure with the Biscayan, “with his sword on high, determined to cut him in half” (Cervantes 64). In this state of violence is where Don Quixote feels most at home but paradoxically so does a modern Spain.</p>
				<p>	This juxtaposition between Don Quixote’s obsession with the past and how it seems to be—at least partially—representative of modern Spain is never more striking than at the inn. With the fall of feudalism and the beginning of the age of exploration occurring across Europe new institutions and classes were arising to fill the new needs of society. One of these innovations was the inn. There trade, travel, and commerce is taken on by new classes. Prostitutes, a mule driver, a priest, and an inn keeper are named among the inhabitants of the inn. People from relatively different stations of life traveling would not have been a reality a hundred years earlier. In this heart of modernity, Don Quixote imposes his will and false view on to others. He presses his will and agenda on to the guests of the inn and eventually the hosts folds and “to cut matters short and give him the accursed order of chivalry” (Cervantes 33). His archaic actions reflect the modern ideals of the society in which he lives. As Spain is pressing its will onto the Americas so too is Don Quixote. The modern setting of the inn further stresses how Don Quixote is using his utopia to retreat to the past, yet modernity manages to catch up to him.</p>
				<p>	This surety and faith in his utopia is then fundamentally disturbed when he encounters the shepherds. Throughout the novel Don Quixote extols the pastoral life style. Before his first adventure and finding the inn Don Quixote “wished he could find…a sheepfold with shepherds where he might take shelter and alleviate his great hunger and need” (Cervantes 26). But, when he final finds one to take him in they are stricken with grief, blaming the death of the “famous student shepherd named Grisóstomo” on Marcela (Cervantes 81). Whom they nearly accuse of murdering Grisóstomo because of how he “died of love for that accursed girl” (Cervantes 81). In spite of the tragedy Don Quixote falls in love with the pastoral lifestyle as it recalls him to the  “‘fortunate age and fortunate times called golden’” because, “‘those who lived in that time did not know the two words <em>thine</em> and <em>mine</em>’” (Cervantes 76). This communal, simple, and shared life style deeply appealed to Don Quixote. And it clearly wares on his mind, at one point he goes on to extol how “it grieves my very soul that I have taken up the profession of knight errant in an age as despicable as the one we live in now” (Cervantes 333). Here he is not blaming knight-errantry as a utopia of having inherent faults. This, in conjunction with the conversation he and Sancho have on their final return journey home about how they intend to “exercise our imaginations and plan the pastoral life we intend to lead’” (Cervantes 928). But, because he choses to never live this life he does not explicitly decide that pastoralism is the more utopian path. Rather, he blames modernity for making his utopia unlivable.</p>
				<p><em>Don Quixote</em> has a lot to say on the subject of utopia through the adventures of its main character. Don Quixote finds and lives out his dreams as questing as a knight. However, along his journey he realizes that his impossible to live in aside a modern world. Don Quixote spends the book using his utopia to run from modernity. However, he is never able escape it. When, though his adventure with the shepherds, Don Quixote realizes the inevitability of the of his retreat. He is never able to recover from this shattering of his illusion. In this way he is unable to experience a real, physical utopia and is only able to manifest his ideals through his actions. Meanwhile Cervantes, throughout the entirety of the book, is a mystery. His writes Don Quixote traipsing though modernity using chivalry, antiquity, and even pastoralism to justify a utopia. And in the end, Don Quixote cannot find utopia, nor can does he find safety or happiness in modernity. As much as he retreats he is never able to escape time.</p>
