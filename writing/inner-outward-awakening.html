				<h1>How Nick Shapes <em>The Great Gatsby</em></h1>
				<p>Throughout <em>The Great Gatsby</em> by F. Scott Fitzgerald major themes such as class, time, and the American dream combined to create the overtones of the novel. In exploring these themes <em>The Great Gatsby</em> keeps one aspect of its storytelling constant: the narrator, Nick. On the surface, Nick—a pleasant, everyday man—character’s contradictions not only define him but frame the novel. Throughout the novel, Nick is forced to stand alone from the rest of the cast. In spite of, and perhaps because of, his contradictions F. Scott Fitzgerald positions Nick as the main protagonist of the novel. Throughout the novel, Nick’s purpose is to act as a character who does not belong. He does not conform with any of the characters in terms of geography, morality, or character. Nick does not engage in the same behavior as the rest of the cast and so an outsider he paints all characters as outsiders, especially Jay Gatsby.</p>
				<p>One of Nick’s contradictions is how he simultaneously occupies the center of the novel, orchestrating and describing its events, while also consistently shifting, throughout the book, the novel’s focus away from himself, placing himself in the peripheral. Rather, he stands aside and describes; including himself when needed and politely excusing himself the remaining time. Nick's geographic location—his spatial identity—mirrors this positioning within the framework of the novel. To emphasize his centrality to the novel, Nick immediately mentions in passing that he and his family belong to “prominent, well-to-do people in a middle-western city for three generations” (Fitzgerald 4). Nick's origin from the midwest mirrors his centrality in the novel while also demonstrating his existence as fundamentally different from the rest of the East-Coast characters. Due to his midwestern roots, Nick is the definition of an outsider to the East Coast. Nick finds himself as both integral to the events of the novel and yet cannot seem to understand his identity or define himself within the same context as the other figures in the novel. Yet, in the context of America's geography as a whole—being from the midwest—Nick takes the stage as one of the most central characters.</p>
				<p>Throughout <em>The Great Gatsby</em> F. Scott Fitzgerald attaches important significance to the positions—both social and geographical—relative to one another. Understanding how these positions relate is key to parts of the symbolism used throughout the novel. For example, the symbolism of the directionality of neighborhoods comes up repeatedly and reflects the character’s social relationships towards one another. Nick calls the “West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two” (Fitzgerald 5) and Tom declares “I’ll stay in the East…I’d be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else” (Fitzgerald 10). Nick’s place of birth when compared to the rest of the novel’s characters acts in a similar way. His positioning geographically, being born in the midwest, directly reflects his social position in New York, an outsider. He effectively becomes a foreigner in the eyes of New York. From his outsider position, Nick understands the interplay between the East Egg, and West Egg; the old money, and new money. And when he narrates this dynamic he has a Midwestern, outside perspective.</p>
				<p>As a narrator, Nick takes this outsider perspective and his father’s words into account, “‘Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,’ he told me, ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.’” (Fitzgerald 2). As a narrator, Nick acts as a sharp foil to Gatsby who “sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God…he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception, he was faithful to the end” (Fitzgerald 89). While Nick constantly reflects on the outside world, Gatsby focuses entirely inwards, creating himself with little regard for everyone else. Therefore, Nick occupies the role of an outsider, not only socially and geographically, but also in terms of morality when compared to Gatsby and the rest of the novel’s characters. Fitzgerald purposefully positions Nick at the center of the novel, but because Nick is so separated from the rest of the characters he can only look on and judge, remembering the advantages that he has had. This contrast between narrator and subjects sets up the remainder of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> for confusion.</p>
				<p>Nicks, self-controlled style of narration, which self-decreed centrality, guides the narrative, is also reflective in his actions as a character. When invited to Gatsby’s first party, Nick, “wandered around rather ill-at-ease among swirls and eddies of people” (Fitzgerald 38). These same people who “were not invited—they went there” (Fitzgerald 38). Despite the fact that he was explicitly invited and belonged at the party, Nick still feels uncomfortable with the situation and strangers. Even though Nick, throughout the novel, is constantly surrounded by excess he never feels comfortable in it. He takes a level and measured approach in a world that seemingly goes all in. A level and measured approach, a trait often valued in narrators has the opposite effect on Nick’s narration. They amount to Nick, at the best of times being slightly out of place to at worst him being totally unreliable. Nick desperately wants to be seen as the reliable narrator he believes that he is. Nick proclaims himself to be "one of the few honest people that I have ever known” (Fitzgerald 54).</p>
				<p>Nick, has reluctant feelings regarding what the future holds for him. He simultaneously feels that in New York City, “anything can happen now” (Fitzgerald 55) and that as a clerk he is “wasting the most poignant moments of night and life” (Fitzgerald 46). Nick, pairs nicely with Gatsby in this respect, who, “beats on…borne back ceaselessly into the past” (Fitzgerald 202). Both of them are outsiders but in different ways. Nick is unable to feel like he belongs to the East Coast and its social rules. Yet, he like Gatsby feels the pull of the possibility that “anything can happen” (Fitzgerald 55). Nick ultimately paints Gatsby as an insider, but different from himself. Gatsby is able to belong, but only through lies borne of an inadequate past.</p>
				<p> Throughout The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald uses Nick as the ultimate outsider to the narrative of the novel. Nick is separated from the rest of the cast of characters in terms of geography, social understanding, and morality. Nick accepts this throughout the novel and incorporates it into his narration. His position relative to the rest of the characters necessarily positions him as unreliable despite the fact that Nick tries as hard as possible to remain objective throughout the novel. This clash between objectivity and reliability is brought to a head when Nick is forced to describe himself throughout the novel and when he describes Gatsby. In the end, Nick presents Gatsby as an outsider, like himself, but ultimately cut from a different dye. Gatsby is an outsider who can fake belong while Nick is one who has to return to what he understands.</p>
