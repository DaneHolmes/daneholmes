				<h1>Edna’s Outward and Inner Takes on Suicide in <em>The Awakening</em></h1>
				<p>In many ways, Edna Pontellier's suicide at the end of <em>The Awakening</em> by Kate Chopin leaves much to be desired. Up to this point, it appeared that Edna’s life was just starting to become full of possibility and freedom promised by her “awakening.” At this point in <em>The Awakening</em>, Edna could have reconciled with her husband, run away with Robert Lebrun, maintained her affair with Alcée Arobin, or even any combination of those possibilities. However, these possibilities are all based upon men. Yet, shortly after all these possibilities become open to her she chooses to swim into the ocean and drown. Her suicide can be seen in two very different lights. Firstly, a moment of triumphant freedom from men who wish to possess her and liberation from the social laws the bind her. Secondly, her suicide can be as a resignation and addition of defeat. Given that at this point in the novel she is freer and more liberated at any other point it is not a stretch to see her suicide as surrender and a return to nature. <em>The Awakening</em> allows for the possibility that both of these conclusions could be potentially correct. Edna’s suicide is neither a triumphant decision for freedom nor an admission of defeat. Rather, Kate Chopin uses her death to criticize different aspects of society. Chopin outwardly uses Edna’s suicide to criticize the society that pushed her to this point, while inwardly critiquing Edna’s decision to abandon societal norms to the point of legitimizing suicide.</p>
				<p>The idea of duality present throughout the whole of <em>The Awakening</em>. Every theme seems to come with its natural opposite. Action is met with reflection, freedom is balanced with emptiness, and individuality with social convention. Edna accepts and embraces what she perceives to be a dual nature to life, “at a very early period she had apprehended instinctively the dual life—that outward existence which conforms, the inward life which questions” (Chopin 42). The idea that life is duality obsesses Edna and she examines every aspect of life with the lens that outwardly there is conformity, but inwardly there is questioning. For Edna to see her suicide as merely triumphant would be a fundamental oversight of her Edna proceeds through the world throughout the whole of <em>The Awakening</em>. Instead, it is necessary to examine how Edna and Kate Chopin saw the ending as outwardly conforming, but inwardly questioning.</p>
				<p>The idea of suicide seems to first be planted in Edna’s mind when Madame Ratignolle is giving birth to her child. This experience recalls memories of Edna’s own child birthing experience. During this scene, Edna reflects that “with an inward agony, with a flaming, outspoken revolt against the ways of Nature, she witnessed the scene of torture” (Chopin 337). Again her Edna is examining life with an inward and outward lens. And inwardly she only sees agony brought about by a revolt against nature. The birth of a child—in all respects a very natural, human thing—only causes her pain. Edna sees this “revolt against nature” outwardly as a continuation of all the systems that she has grown to hate over the course of her “awakening.” Childbirth at this moment acts as the impetus—and as a symbol—for all the things in society that Edna perceives as subjugating women. It is with children, and with nature as justification, that society is able to divide women’s duties between themselves and their children. And again in suicide Edna return to the idea of children. She reflects how “the children appeared before her like antagonists who had overcome her; who had overpowered and sought to drag her into the soul’s slavery for the rest of her days” (Chopin 350). Outwardly, again Chopin is putting the blame for the suicide on society's shoulders. Concluding it is the choice of society to have children overpower their mother’s individuality. And ominously that there is only one“way to elude” the pressures of society.</p>
				<p>Inwardly, however, Edna’s suicide tells a different story. Outwardly, Edna clearly knows her philosophy and is able to perceive the world around her in a way that consistently fits her perception. Yet, inwardly, as a woman, Edna, and her “half-awakened senses” seem almost lost (Chopin 97). Often the novel refers to her as living through important events while admitting that “she was not thinking” (Chopin 350). Edna, therefore, is clearly out of touch with her feeling and desires. The division between this outward confidence and inward skepticism comes to a head with her relationship early in the novel with Robert Lebrun. On the island, Edna was the only person oblivious to the sexual tension that dominated their relationship. In fact, Edna’s senses are so “half-awakened” that she does not realize her sexual feelings towards Robert until he has left her life. Only after he leaves does she realize, “for the first time…the symptoms of infatuation which she had felt incipiently as a child, as a girl in her earliest teens, and later as a young woman” (Chopin 137). While Edna is aware and hyper-focused on society's failings she is unaware of and unable to process her own deepest emotion. At the time of her suicide, it is impossible to believe that she was thinking clearly and deeply about her own inward feelings. And to some degree, that blame falls on society. Everyone in her life seems more aware of her emotions than she is. The whole island knew of the sexual overtones to her relationship with Robert. Alcée Arobin too understands her emotions and uses her for an affair. Throughout Edna’s life the society she began to reject neglected her and helped to bury her inward spirit.</p>
				<p>The conclusion of <em>The Awakening</em> and Edna’s suicide is a morally vague scene. Edna’s death can ultimately be seen as either as a moment of liberation or of resignation. Throughout the novel, Edna focuses on the outward and inward motivations for every aspect of life. She is hyper-aware and critical of the outward appearance of society, yet is almost lost when it comes to her own inward feelings. Kate Chopin uses her death to criticize different aspects of society. Chopin outwardly uses Edna’s suicide to criticize the society that pushed her to this point, while inwardly critiquing Edna’s decision to abandon societal norms to the point of legitimizing suicide.</p>
