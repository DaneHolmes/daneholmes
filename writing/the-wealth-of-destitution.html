			<h1><strong>The Wealth of Destitution</strong></h1>
				<p>“She loved the sea only got its storms, and the green grass only when it grew in patches among ruins.”</p>
				<p>-Gustave Flaubert</p>
			<h2>Chapter One: Thunder Without Rain</h2>
				<p>In the mid-autumn of that year, I rented a room in a town that looked over the cliffs, and on to the sea, and sometimes onto the rising sun. Despite my habit of waking up early to take long walks in the salt-filled, fall air, I rarely saw the sunrise. That year the trees along the sea were caught in an indefinite state of deepening color yet battled an unwillingness to have their leaves fall.</p>
				<p>As I walked under these trees, along the ocean, the sea mist obscuring all my senses, the rain would fall. The rain fell, the mist soaked through me, and I walked. Walking the same roads, I told myself I was going aimlessly. I followed the ocean and the trees, listening with my dulled senses to the white-crested, iron waves break onto the cliffs and crash into my ear.</p>
				<p>All that autumn, the road along the cliffs, outside of town, and under the trees, was red and alive. A combination of two-slatted fences and short-stone walls—faded with age at their tops—lined the road, whose surface was dense with puddles. Leaves slipped from branches, falling with the rain, dropping at my feet. And every morning, the sun rose, softening the sky and turning its edges pale.</p>
				<p>I kept walking, sometimes looking up, but mostly down at the nestled leaves and the muddy water running into the folds of the hills. When I lifted my head, fine-beads of mist quickly filled my eyes, circling my vision, reflecting lights into dozens of dancing, yellow points on my eyes.</p>
				<p>I remember the road bent inland, towards the west. Darkly, I looked down that westward road towards the deep, setting sun, whose rays capped the distant hills to the west. The trees bent and set into an ever more unrestrained red until there were no other colors, and the sun sank away. I never walked that road at dusk. But, in the spring, the crickets chirped, and students would run through the hills and between the trees, triumphant. In the spring, the air wasn’t so salty.</p>

				<p>Hector was an Iowan who woke before the sun rose. From the white house on top of the hill, he looked out over the land, his the neighbors land, and on to the stone colored sky. The coldness of the air surrounded him and gripped slowly at his shoulders. He filled his chest often, shrugging off caresses of the cold, willing himself not to shiver. Instead, he looked down the hill of dead, bleached grass covered in that night’s frost. And into the furrow of the hill where the shelterbelt composed of dull pines and the thin-white trunks supporting leafless branches stood. The bone-colored land rolled on and up to the east. There the sky was lighting, subtle steel setting out a pervasive warmth of color, brightening, but not yet lightening than sky.</p>
				<p>In the cold air and warm light, Hector thought about where he would be next year, next December. Too far to come home. Too far to enjoy the days and the nights. It appeared an impossible distance. The lands he would travel over soon would change countless times, and, he thought, so would these mornings baked in freezing air.</p>
				<p>He turned back towards the house with the clay-colored roof, away from the road wandering west and venturing east. The road traveling under the sky, which seemed to proclaim, “what so ever things are true!” But, as the eastern sky to Hector’s back continued to lighten, it remained just as cold.</p>

				<p>Far away, but not apart, Eliza sat under the loneliest tree she knew, thinking of the land. Of the valley where she was born, where she had grown up and lived, and where she wanted to leave. She sat, recalling again how and when she had first come to sit under its leaves. The branches then had covered the blue sky and cast a cold shade upon her. The tree from whose branches she had seen the spirits fly away and who she had sworn to follow. She had come to peace under that tree, but now it only served as an obelisk of discontent.</p>
				<p>Her face was a true reflection of the country responsible for her growing inner cheerlessness. Just has hills rolled reliably, and small—creating valleys people lived and traveled—her face seemed to dip from cheekbone to jaw. In her stare, she reflected the endless, empty sky. And her smile revealed the momentary nature of it all. Unnoticed by her little bugs flew, attracted to the bottle she had brought. As they drew to the drink, they drown in its sweet contents, unable to escape.</p>
				<p>The land was Eliza Fernum, and she hated it.</p>
