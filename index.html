      <h1>Hello! My name is <span class="name">Dane Holmes</span> and this is all about me.</h1>
      
      <section>
        <p>I am a currently a third-year student at Northwestern University where I am majoring in English Literature, as well as getting minors in computer and data science.</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I currently live in Chicago, but prior to living here, I lived in Tokyo, Japan. After graduating from Lane Tech College Prep in 2017, I went to Truman College and graduated as a presidential scholar with an Associate of Arts degree in a year and a half. After finishing community college, before starting at Northwestern, I worked for the Chicago Public Library as a Cyber Navigator. There, I traveled all over Chicago helping amazing people with countless issues, and I would not trade the experience for anything.</p>
        <p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> As a Cyber Navigator, I helped at least 15 people get jobs, assisted with one divorce, filed all kinds of taxes, edited one novel, and so much more.</p>
        <p>Outside of school and work, I spend my time making websites, like this one, teaching my self programming, and, recently, learning as much as I can about computer networking and privacy. Outside of my computer bubble, I row for the Northwestern crew team, try to read and write, and play lacrosse pretty casually.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Affixionary</h3>
        <p><a href="https://affixionary.com">Affixionary</a> is a website that serves as an etymological dictionary of English affixes. Currently, it only contains prefixes, but I hope to soon add suffixes and bases. I also hope to rebuild it soon and possibly implement a free, open API.</p>
        <h3>My Writing</h3>
        <p>I have included some of <a href="https://write.daneholmes.com">my writing</a> because though, while not strictly a project, it reflects time and reflect on my part regarding something I am passionate about. I have included some academic and personal pieces.</p>
        <h3>GitHub</h3>
        <p>On <a href="https://github.com/daneholmes">GitHub</a> you can find some of my smaller coding projects. And, actually, you can find the <a href="https://github.com/daneholmes/daneholmes.com">source code</a> (and all my embarrassing revisions) for this website, if you are curious.</p>
