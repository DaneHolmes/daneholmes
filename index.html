			<h1>Hello! My name is <span class="name">Dane Holmes</span> and this is all about me.</h1>
				
			<section>
				<p>I am a currently a third-year student at Northwestern University where I am double majoring in English Literature and statistics, as well as getting a minor in data science.</p>
				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I currently live in Chicago, but prior to living here, I lived in Tokyo, Japan. After graduating from Lane Tech College Prep in 2017, I went to Truman College and graduated as a presidential scholar with an Associate of Arts degree in a year and a half. After finishing community college, before starting at Northwestern, I worked for the Chicago Public Library as a Cyber Navigator. There, I traveled all over Chicago helping amazing people with countless issues, and I would not trade the experience for anything.</p>
				<p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> As a Cyber Navigator, I helped at least 15 people get jobs, assisted with one divorce, filed all kinds of taxes, edited one novel, and so much more.</p>
				<p>Outside of school and work, I spend my time making websites, like this one, teaching my self programming, and, recently, learning as much as I can about computer networking and privacy. Outside of my computer bubble, I row for the Northwestern crew team, try to read and write, and play lacrosse pretty casually.</p>

				<h2>Projects</h2>
					<h3>Affixionary</h3>
						<p class="indent"><a href="https://affixionary.com">Affixionary</a> is a website that serves as an etymological dictionary of English affixes. Currently, it only contains prefixes, but I hope to soon add suffixes and bases. I also hope to rebuild it soon and possibly implement a free, open API.</p>
					<h3>Crypto-Dash</h3>
						<p class="indent"><a href="https://github.com/DaneHolmes/CRYPTO-DASH">Crypto-Dash</a> is a shiny app framework mostly written in  tidyverse R. It automatically preforms basic financial analysis of live cryptocurrency data and displays the information through a variety of graphs. Crypto-Dash is still being improved in how it display trends in the most common cryptocurrencies. </p>
