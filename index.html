			<h1 style="text-align: center;">Hello! My name is <strong>Dane Holmes</strong> and this is all about me.</h1>
			
			<p>I am a currently a third-year student at Northwestern University where I am majoring in English Literature, as well as getting minors in computer and data science.</p>
			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I currently live in Chicago, but prior to living here, I lived in Tokyo, Japan. After graduating from Lane Tech College Prep in 2017, I went to Truman College and graduated as a presidential scholar with an Associate of Arts degree in a year and a half. After finishing community college, before starting at Northwestern, I worked for the Chicago Public Library as a Cyber Navigator. There, I traveled all over Chicago helping amazing people with countless issues, and I would not trade the experience for anything.</p>
				<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> As a Cyber Navigator, I helped at least 15 people get jobs, assisted with one divorce, filed all kinds of taxes, edited one novel, and so much more.</p>
				<p>Outside of school and work, I spend my time making websites, like this one, teaching my self programming, and, recently, learning as much as I can about computer networking and privacy. Outside of my computer bubble, I row for the Northwestern crew team, try to read and write, and play lacrosse pretty casually.</p>
