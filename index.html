			<h1>Hello! My name is <span class="name"">Dane Holmes</span> and this is all about me.</h1>
				
			<section>
				<p>I am a currently a third year student at Northwestern University where I am double majoring in English Literature, and statistics, as well as getting a minor in data science.</p>
				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I currently live in Chicago—right by Wriggly Field—but prior to living here I lived in Tokyo, Japan. After graduating from Lane Tech College Prep in 2017, I went to Truman College and graduated with an associate of arts in a year-and-a-half. I spent my time in between community college and Northwestern working for the Chicago Public Library as a <em>Cyber Navigator</em>. There, I traveled all over Chicago helping amazing people with countless issues and I would not trade the experience for anything.</p>
				<p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> As a Cyber Navigator I've helped at least 15 people get jobs,  assist with one divorce, file all kinds of taxes, edit one novel, and so much more; I could talk about it for days. So why not contact me bellow?</p>
				<p>Outside of school and work I spend my time making websites, like this one, teaching my self programming, and recently, learning as much as I can about computer networking and privacy. Outside of my computer bubble I also row for the Northwestern crew team, am a member of ΣΑΕ, and casually play lacrosse.</p>

					<h3>Affixionary</h3>
						<p class="indent"><a href="https://affixionary.com">Affixionary</a> is a website that serves as an etymological dictionary of English affixes. Currently, it only contains prefixes, but I hope to soon add suffixes and bases. I also hope to rebuild it soon and possibly implement a free, open API.</p>
