  <h1>Writing Portfolio</h1>
  <p>I say “portfolio,” however this acts more as a collection of random stories and essays that I have written, and for-some-reason-or-another enjoyed. Enjoy.</p>

        <p><a href="/writing/Madame-Bovary/"><p><em>Madame Bovary</em>, by Gustave Flaubert, manages to say a lot while seemingly not taking any significant positions. The novel achieves this in two ways. First, the narration throughout the novel is dispassionate, bordering on apathetic, causing it to offer an unbiased report of the novel’s happenings.</p>

        <p><a href="/writing/Don-Quixote/"><p><em>Don Quixote</em> by Miguel De Cervantes is about Don Quixote and his quest to find and validate his idea of utopia. His first adventure where he becomes knighted at an inn acts as a microcosm for the novel as a whole.</p>

        <p><a href="/writing/Fall-Description/"><p>In the late-summer of that year, I rented a room in a town that looked over the cliffs, and on to the sea, and sometimes onto the rising sun. Despite my habit of waking up early to take long walks in the salt-filled air, I rarely saw the sunrise. That year the trees along the sea were caught in an indefinite state of deepening color yet battled an unwillingness to have their leaves fall.</p>
