	<h1>Description as the Critical Narrator in Madame Bovary</h1>
	<p><em>Madame Bovary</em>, by Gustave Flaubert, manages to say a lot while seemingly not taking any significant positions. The novel achieves this in two ways. First, the narration throughout the novel is dispassionate, bordering on apathetic, causing it to offer an unbiased report of the novel’s happenings.<!--more--> This narrative style creates an environment where <em>Madame Bovary’s</em> narrator ultimately reserves final judgment of itself for the reader. Secondly, Flaubert’s use of descriptions creates highly realistic scenes whose memories ripple thought the whole novel. To realize this realistic atmosphere, Flaubert uses an unceasing barrage of description to recount everything from the trivial to the consequential to create. In this effort, the description ends up being expansive, but it also ends up placing equal stress and equal significance on every event and action. Because the narrator is so restrained, the novel ends up having to defer emphasis and judgment onto the description. The description in the novel then subtly offers criticism and critiques of its characters. It does this through a combination of passive narration and rich description.</p>

<p><em>Madame Bovary’s</em> narration is unemotional to the point of apathy and is distinctly restrained. Even when Emma performs the cruelest of actions, the narrator merely offers the necessary context and synthesis. For example, after Emma fires Nastasie, the narration is ambivalent to Emma’s spontaneous cruelty and Charles’s feelings towards their maid. “They could hear Nastasie crying. He [Charles] was rather fond of the poor girl. In the past, after he was widowed, she had kept him company through many an empty evening. She was his first patient, his oldest acquaintance in the place” (Flaubert 50). The narration, when focusing on Charles’s extensive past with Nastasie, does not even convey any character’s emotions. The narrator never outright says that Charles was sad or even upset. These feelings can be possibly inferred from the history that the narrator shares, but emotional judgment is never given. In only sharing background, the narrator does not have to make any emotional commentary regarding the morality of her firing, leaving that judgment entirely up to the reader. Madame Bovary’s general narrative tone follows the model of this scene. An atrocious action, worthy of criticism, happens, and the narrator simply focuses on the context or ramifications of the action. This narrative detachment is one essential aspect of how the novel imparts its beliefs and levels of criticism.</p>

<p>In surrendering the emotional emphasis of narration, the novel gains a perceived sense of freedom. This “freedom” is partially accomplished by the narrator reserving emotional judgment, as previously mentioned. However, this is additionally done by the narrator, presenting a clear story of cause and effect. That is to say, the novel clearly demonstrates how a character’s actions lead to consequences. Nevertheless, <em>Madame Bovary’s</em> narrator never tells readers how to think or feel. The morality of character’s actions and to what extent the repercussions are just is a decision left entirely up to the reader. An example of this freedom of choice created due to the unemotional narration is the effect the Viscount’s ball has upon Emma’s soul and temperament. When she returns home, she realizes that “her satin slippers,” have become “yellowed by the beeswax on the dance floor.” The narrator blandly comments that “her heart was like them: contact with riches had left something on it that would never rub off” (Flaubert 51). Firstly, the narrator presents a clear cause and effect: Emma goes to the ball and leaves with a love of money imprinted on to her soul. In this passage, the narration never passes any judgment on to Emma. The narrator never comments one way or another if a love of money good or bad. It only states Emma became avaricious due to her attending the ball and the effects that the visit has upon her soul. Of course, anti-capitalist and Marxist critiques are easily drawn from these events. However, the narrator makes no attempts at doing so, allowing the reader to choose to pull meaning and importance from events.</p>

<p>The narration—both through intentional emotional apathy and through allowing readers complete freedom in leveling judgment—ultimately defers all emotional responsibility. However, in doing this, the narrator is able to maintain authority. When Emma fires Nastasie, the narrator’s insight into Charles’s emotional center is infallible. When Emma returns from the Viscount’s ball, there is no doubt of her avariciousness because the narrator said it was so. The narration is authoritative in every sense except emotional. This lack of emotional authority is how—and where—Flaubert defers judgment onto the intense description.</p>

<p>The lengths that Gustave Flaubert goes to increase the realism of his description is immense. And not without purpose. Long descriptions of seemingly pointless objects, places, thoughts, and feelings fill the pages, whether it is a paragraph description of the bizarre hat “the new boy was still holding…on his knees” (Flaubert 5) or imagery of how Charles loved “feeling the gate swing open under the pressure of his shoulder” (Flaubert 17) when he first visits Les Bertaux. These intense, but apparently random, moments of realism are never pointless. Flaubert’s least consequential description vividly paints a broader picture. Like when Charles first visits Les Bertaux. The fact he opens the door with “the pressure of his shoulder” (Flaubert 17) is alone suggestive because of how very intimate it is in nature. Especially when compared to pushing the door open with his shoulder to knocking or opening the door with his hands. These alternatives would have been much more typical and would not have expressed how immediately at home, Charles felt at Les Bertaux. The narrator paints the farm at Les Bertaux as a utopia in a disinterested manner. Throughout two pages of description, the narrator describes Les Bertaux saying it “was a prosperous-looking farm” with “brand-new mangers,” “five or six peacocks,” (Flaubert 15), and, finally, that Charles “loved going to Les Bertaux” (Flaubert 17). How Charles opens the door ends up being one inconsequential detail among pages of description. However, each individual detail is not pointless. They all build up to paint a scene of a man immediately at home and happy. As a whole, the realistic description paints important images of characters and serves to increase the novel’s verisimilitude. And, importantly, when looked at minutely, sentences hint towards themes and character’s feelings.</p>

<p>This description is not just nuanced and significant in that it hints towards themes, feelings, and ambitions. But it also presents an agenda, where the narrator chooses not to. One example of judgment being passed entirely through detail is when Emma first commits adultery with Rodolphe. Emma finally “experiences those joys of love” (Flaubert 144) in the forest. Specifically, on “the edge of a small pond where duck-weed covered the water with green. Shriveled water lilies floated, motionless, among the reeds” and “at the sound of their footsteps on the grass, frogs leapt for cover” (Flaubert 143). Without saying anything directly, the description initially passes judgment upon Emma through the detail of Emma first committing adultery in public, outside, and in front of God.</p>

<p>Not only is it a very public affair, but it is next to a gross and dying pond. Duckweed, which “covered the water with green” (Flaubert 143), is a tiny plant that floats on the surface of the water. When left unchecked will cover the whole surface, cutting off light to the plants below the surface and eventually depriving the pond of its nutrients. This plant passes judgment onto Emma and her romantic beliefs. They symbolize how her desperate romantic needs cover every other aspect of her life and will eventually destroy her. Then the realistic description turns to the other plant in the water: the “shriveled water lilies” (Flaubert 143). Lilies traditionally symbolize purity and love—and they are dying. But the lilies do not only demonstrate how Emma has lost purity. Because the lilies were, presumably, choked by the duckweed. The flower’s death shows how Emma’s yearning for love affects Charles and even her daughter. Her fancies are choking them off from life and, too, will eventually destroy them. Finally, their appearance sends the frogs to “leap for cover” (Flaubert 143). The word “cover” demonstrates that Emma’s actions cause people to run away from her for safety. It says that her chasing romance is causing people in her life to leave her. Léon and Rodolphe both reach an endpoint with Emma and leave. In this way, minute descriptions not only serve to increase the realism of the novel but also subtly pass judgment and foretell what is to come.</p>

<p>Throughout the novel, the description’s judgment is mainly pointed towards Emma and her obsession with chasing a seemingly impossible romance. The narrator describes Emma as a woman who “loved the sea only for its storms, and the green grass only when it grew in patches among the ruins” (Flaubert 34). Again, this is dispassionate narration. It is only giving examples of how Emma chooses to see the world. However, it is also the telling of Emma and the novel as a whole. Throughout <em>Madame Bovary</em>, the description pays equal attention to the romantic events of immense importance to Emma and provincial life at the same time. This paradigm is never more apparent than at the fair when Emma first meets Rodolphe. The novel uses this juxtaposition between reality and drama to criticize Emma and undercut romance. The sea is not only storms and most grass doesn’t grow among ruins, yet she can only see the romantic, dramatic aspect of life. The realism of the novel acts like the sea, and like grass, it is intensely normal. The banality of the description creates an obstacle for romance to overcome.</p>

<p>The juxtaposition between description and narration in <em>Madame Bovary</em> is how the novel balances its arguments. The dispassionate narration throughout the novel creates an unbiased environment that is key to making the novel seem free to read and interpret—reserving final judgment in all cases for the reader. The descriptions, therefore, subtly take up the role of the criticizer. The bombardment of description regarding every detail places stress on both events and actions. The description in the novel then subtly offers criticism and critiques of its characters. Ultimately, the novel criticizes Romanticism through a combination of passive narration and rich description.</p>
