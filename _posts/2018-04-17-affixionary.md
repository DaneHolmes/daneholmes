Affixionary is a dictionary of prefixes that I have been working on for about the last two years. The idea started in middle school when I had weekly projects to learn a handful of prefixes.<!--more--> Doing the research was the hardest part because information always seemed incomplete or sometimes wrong.

Above is the picture of the current homepage of Affixionary. It is built on Wordpress partially because when I started this project it was the platform I understood the best and I had a adequate knowledge of php.

Every prefix has a definition, example sentence, example word, and visual to help learners.

There is also a section with a rough overview of how prefixes work.

This is still a work-in-progress, but I have not had a chance to work on it recently. The next big project is to add more prefixes and start on suffixes. I then want to make the search functionality on the website much more clear as well as autocomplete and auto-return results. Further down the pipeline I would like to move it off Wordpress and make a publicly callable api.
