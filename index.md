<h1 style="font-variation-settings: 'wght' 250;">Hello! My name is <strong>Dane Holmes</strong> and this is all about me.</h1>

I am a currently a fourth-year student at Northwestern University where I am majoring in English Literature, as well as getting minors in computer and data science.

<h2>About Me</h2>
I currently live in Chicago, but prior to living here, I lived in Tokyo, Japan. After graduating from Lane Tech College Prep in 2017, I went to Truman College and graduated as a Presidential Scholar with an Associate of Arts degree in a year and a half. After finishing community college, before starting at Northwestern, I worked for the Chicago Public Library as a Cyber Navigator. There, I traveled all over Chicago helping amazing people with countless issues, and I would not trade the experience for anything.

<strong>Fun Fact:</strong> As a Cyber Navigator, I helped at least 15 people get jobs, assisted with one divorce, edited one novel, saved one house, filed all kinds of taxes, and so much more.

Outside of school and work, I spend my time making websites, like this one, teaching myself programming, and, recently, learning as much as I can about computer networking and privacy. Outside of my computer bubble, I row for the Northwestern crew team, try to read and write, and play lacrosse pretty casually.
